## MadLibs

MadLibs is a Java application that generates a silly story based on user-provided words.  
The program prompts the user for a series of inputs (nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.) and incorporates them into a predefined narrative template.  
This project demonstrates Java concepts such as methods, parameter passing, string manipulation, and using the `Scanner` class.
