#MadLibs

MadLibs is a Java application that generates a silly story based on user-provided words.  
The program prompts the user for a series of inputs (nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.) and incorporates them into a predefined narrative template.  
This project demonstrates fundamental Java concepts including methods, parameter passing, string manipulation, and user interaction through the `Scanner` class.
